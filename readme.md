> This ansible playbook will make your machine lovely to use

## This playbook is only intended to be run in `Ubuntu 22.04`

This is my - **@TheLaluka** - own config, shared with the help & motivation of **@Fransosiche** !

- Welcome to my world, `Lower The Friction` between you and your machine!
- See this brief extract of what these scripts will allow you to do

## This video is a quick how-to

Note that:

- Around 40GB of free space is needed for a full setup
- The install time will be SIGNIFICANTLY longer for a first run

## Sum-Up

The ansible playbook `main.yml` applies 4 ansible roles which are:

- roles/base-install
- roles/offensive-stuff
- roles/gui-tools
- roles/hardening

## Pre-Install, Install, Update

```bash
# Pre-install
sudo apt install -y curl wget git vim tmux # Basics
git clone https://github.com/laluka/lalubuntu
# If you plan to contribute, use: git@github.com:laluka/lalubuntu.git
sudo mv lalubuntu /opt/lalubuntu
cd /opt/lalubuntu
bash -x pre-install.sh

# Main Install
bash -x install.sh
# If anything fails, the install won't be complete (ansible StopOnFail intended behavior)
# So you'll have to fix (or commment) the failing task and re-run install.sh!

# Stay Up-To-Date
lalupdate
```

## Install Specific Roles Only

Remember that `offensive-stuff` and `gui-tools` require `base-install`

```bash
# Only shell goodies
ansible-playbook -vvv -i inventory.ini --ask-become main.yml --tags base-install
# Offensive work on a headless server -> requires base-install
ansible-playbook -vvv -i inventory.ini --ask-become main.yml --tags offensive-stuff
# Smooth term & GUI for non-offensive folks -> requires base-install
ansible-playbook -vvv -i inventory.ini --ask-become main.yml --tags gui-tools
# Do the security thingy
ansible-playbook -vvv -i inventory.ini --ask-become main.yml --tags hardening
```

## Packer - Requirements

```bash
# Installing packer with mise-en-place
mise plugin add packer
mise install packer@latest
mise use -g packer@latest
packer --version # Packer v1.10.1
```

## Packer - Docker Images

> I provide public images support only, if you want to build your own comment the "docker-push" packer post-processor!

### Build You Own

```bash
# Build Docker Layers
export DOCK_USER=thelaluka
export DOCK_PASS=LALU_SECRET_HIHI
env | grep -F DOCK
packer init packer/lbt-docker.pkr.hcl
# COMMENT OUT ALL THE DOCKER LOGIN/PUSH LINES
grep 'post-processor "docker-push"'packer/lbt-docker.pkr.hcl
# Then build :)

# Then refer to "Usage"
```

## Packer - Digital Ocean

> This will use your account to build the image, snapshot it, and allow easy & fast deploy, single or fleet!

```bash
# Build Digital Ocean
cd /opt/lalubuntu/packer && packer init lbt-digitalocean.pkr.hcl
# export DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
PACKER_LOG=1 PACKER_LOG_PATH="/tmp/pocean-$(date).log" packer build lbt-digitalocean.pkr.hcl
# Then visit https://cloud.digitalocean.com/images/snapshots/droplets & create your droplet from the last SnapShot! :)
export DO_IP=X.X.X.X
ssh "root@$DO_IP" systemctl start nxserver.service
ssh "root@$DO_IP" passwd hacker # Set your password
# Start NoMachine & Connect with hacker:127.0.0.1:4000
# Remember to:
#  - NoMachine -> Set resolution to 1920x1080
#  - NoMachine -> Grab keyboard input (for i3 bindings)
#  - Remote -> Via settings, Set resolution to 1920x1080

## Base install

Base-installs scripts will install all the needed sofware and packages

- This ansible script will first update and install a lot of needed packages. You can view all the packages in `default_packages` variable in `roles/base-install/defaults/main.yml` file
- Then, it will install and configure zsh (file is `zsh-config`)
- Then, the script will install mise (former RTX) and mise packages (`mise-all`)
- After, finishing the configuration of zsh with mise-en-place (file is `zsh-config-post-mise`)
- After that, it will setup a directory named DATA (`setup-dir`)(I used it as my work dir)
- Then, some configuration of vim will be done (`vim-default`)
- Docker and docker compose will be installed (`docker-install`)
- Using fresh rust install, the script will install several tools using cargo (`cargo-dl`)
- A lil' bit of cleanup will be made (`cleanup`)

## Offensive Stuff

Offensive stuff, as the name sounds like, will install all offensive tools (some upgrade could be made tho)

- First, the script will install some tools using golang (`golang-tooling`)
- After that, it will install some tools and wordlists from github (`wordlists-and-tools`)
- A lil' bit of cleanup will be made (`cleanup`)

## Gui tools

Some GUI software such as vscode or office will be installed

- First, it installs common GUI softwares `install-gui-tools` (wireshark, vlc, obs...) (you can find all the packages in `gui_tools_to_install` (`roles/gui-tools/defaults/main.yml`))
- Then, it will installs google chrome (`install-google-chrome`)
- Last but not least, it will download and install veracrypt (`install-veracrypt`)
- Then, install nomachine (`install-nomachine`)
- Then, install discord (`install-discord`)
- Then, install vscode (`install-vscode`)
- Then, install signal (`install-signal`)
- After, it will install and setup regolith because regolith is GOAT (`setup-regolith`)
- To finish, some cleanup ! (`cleanup`)

## Hardening

Some quick hardening will be done :

- First, some ufw (firewall) config `ufw-setup`
- Then disabling some services (vars can be found `roles/hardening/defaults/main.yml`) `disable-service`
- Install (vars can be found `roles/hardening/defaults/main.yml`) `install-secu-packages`
- To finish, some cleanup ! (`cleanup`)

> I rely on chrome for everything I can. I strongly recommend installing the extensions from `chrome-extensions.lst`

---

## Gotchas

- If you are lost, use `Mod+Shift+?` to open the bindings help panel!
- One can switch between Regolith and Gnome by logging out and picking the desired UI
  - In Gnome: Top-Right corner, then logout
  - In Regolith: CMD+SPACE, then logout
